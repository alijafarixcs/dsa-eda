random forest
tree
gini impurity is one of three common algorithm
bagg diff sampling with replacemnet and vote weak learners hard or soft(average) high bias underfit
boost change weights of instances of weak learners and can became high variance (overfit)
stack parallel weak learner diffrent model and vote finally by result of weaks but with new learnenr call blending(last layer)
